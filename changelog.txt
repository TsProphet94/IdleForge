v0.1.18- Milestone Rewards, Platimum, Rebalance!

•   New milestone rewards added for each resource, giving extra goals and bonuses as you progress.
•   New resource: Platinum! Unlock, mine, and upgrade this high-value late-game metal.
•   Major balance update: All resource sell prices increased for smoother progression. Upgrade base prices and scaling reduced across all resources—upgrades are now more affordable and rewarding. Late-game unlock costs and platinum/gold progression tuned for less grind and more satisfying ramp.
•   New Main Menu Background!
•   Passive income and per-click upgrades now scale better with resource value.
•   Early, mid, and late game progression rebalanced for a fair challenge and less paywall cliff.
•   Fixed new game logic, ensuring (mine per click) is reset to 1.
•   Fixed autoseller toggle logic.

v0.1.13 – “Bulk or Bust”

Shop Overhaul
•	Shop moved from a slide-out drawer to its own full screen. Cleaner grid, easier scrolling, way less claustrophobic.
•	Buy Max button added.
•	Button label trimmed: Buy Max, uprgade progress bar.

Economy & Balance Pass
•	Full rebalance of unlock costs and upgrade curves across all resources.
•	Progression tuned for a smooth ramp, not a sheer paywall cliff.
•	Early game still snappy; late game less trivial. Passive income properly considered.

QoL & Polish
•	Unified styling for both Buy buttons (same gradient, hover, disabled states).
•	Dynamic labels/disable states update in-place without janky refreshes.
•	Unlock overlays reliably rebuild after wipes/new games.
•	New stat panel showing global game stats.

Under the Hood
•	Bulk math helpers (bulkCost, bulkAffordable, etc.) centralized and reused.
•	Save/load, autosell timers, and stat tracking cleaned up for fewer edge-case gremlins.
